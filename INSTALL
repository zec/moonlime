To install moonlime, you need GNU Make and a C compiler. To build and install
the program, just `make all; make install' (the latter as superuser). To build
the documentation, you need AsciiDoc and xmlto; run `make doc', and to install,
use `make install-all'. See the Makefile for variables you can change
(C compiler, install directories, etc.).

To create a version of moonlime that will run in the source-tree directory,
just `make'.

Parts of moonlime are themselves lexers generated by moonlime; if you modify
the underlying lexer files (ml-lexer.l and tmpl-lex.l), you need to run
`./bootstrap.sh' to apply your changes into the source tree.
