To install moonlime, you need GNU Make and a C compiler. To build the program,
just `make CC=[C compiler]'. To build the documentation, you need AsciiDoc and
xmlto; run `make doc'.

Parts of moonlime are themselves lexers generated by moonlime; if you modify
the underlying lexer files (ml-lexer.l and tmpl-lex.l), you need to run
`./bootstrap.sh' to apply your changes into the source tree.
